# Experimental-Data-Processing-of-SHPB
Experimental data of rdinary material with obvious strain rate effect from SHPB test can be processed well by this program.

The outputs of program includes relative curves and EXCEL file containg stress, strain and strain data.

During the use of this program, following points need to be concerned:
* Format of input data file. Usually the first several lines in a data file are useless, these lines are not supposed to be read;
* This program regards reflect wave to be negative and transmission wave to be positive by default. You may need to change its signals;
* Basic geometrical data and material constants need to be modified manually;
* The intervals of reflect wave and transmission wave are supposed to be selected carefully, also for the interval of strain which
are used to calculate strain rate;
